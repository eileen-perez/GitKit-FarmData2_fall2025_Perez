 * The navigation location service.

 *
 * Since we update the navigation locations as a side effect of UI events (seting the selection, etc.) We sometimes
 * record intermediate locations which are not considered the "final" location we're navigating to.
 * In order to remedy, clients should always invoke "startNavigation" before registering locations and
 * invoke "endNavigation" when done. Only when no more nested navigations are active ist the last registered
 * location transfered to the navigation "stack".
